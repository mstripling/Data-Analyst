    "<h1 style=\"color:#D4AF37\">Exploratory Analysis of an Electrical Outage Dataset</h1>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>Introduction:</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "While exploring datasets related to the energy sector, I came across a dataset related to electrical outages labeled \"AEMR\" which could be some sort of regulator. Though I had no prior knowledge about this specific company or its operations, I was intrigued to dive deep and uncover insights from the data. This notebook documents my exploratory journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>Objective:</h2>\n",
    "Intrigued by the patterns and trends within the data, I set two primary objectives for my exploratory analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>A) Investigate Energy Stability and Market Outages:</b>\n",
    "I wanted to understand the frequency, duration, and potential causes of these outages. By doing so, I aimed to provide insights into how energy stability might be impacted by these disruptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>B) Examine Energy Losses and Market Reliability:</b>\n",
    "My goal was to quantify the energy losses during these outages and to assess their implications on the overall reliability of the energy market. This could help in understanding the broader consequences of such events and the potential areas of intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>Dataset:</h2>\n",
    "The dataset consists of various outage events, detailing the facility involved, duration, cause, and the power lost.\n",
    "Since the dataset was discovered without accompanying documentation, part of this exploration will involve understanding its structure and content.\n",
    "\n",
    "The four types of outages categorized are:\n",
    "\n",
    "● Consequential\n",
    "\n",
    "● Forced \n",
    "\n",
    "● Opportunistic \n",
    "\n",
    "● Planned \n"
