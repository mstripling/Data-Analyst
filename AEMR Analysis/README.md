# Analysis Summary
If you would like to see this data visualized, [it is available here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/miles.stripling/viz/SQL_16831435735630/Sheet2).

While exploring some datasets, I stumbled upon this intriguing collection of information related to energy outages. Without any accompanying documentation, I embarked on a journey to unravel its secrets. Here's a glimpse of what I've inferred:

* Energy Stability & Market Outages: The data paints a picture of diverse energy outages with forced outages standing out prominently. Their durations, frequencies, and association with specific providers shed light on potential challenges in ensuring energy stability.

* Outages by Participant and Facility: By diving deeper, it became apparent that forced outages have been on the rise over the recent years, hinting at underlying issues in the energy market.

* Averages for Forced Outages: The average durations and energy losses due to these outages emphasize their significant impact on the overall energy landscape.

* Energy Impact of Forced Outages: The deeper layers of the dataset unveiled which participants bore the brunt of these outages, providing a roadmap of where interventions might be most needed.

* Deep Dive into Top Participants' Energy Loss: An in-depth exploration of the top three participants presented a clearer picture of the main culprits behind significant energy losses.

From this seemingly obscure dataset, I've managed to extract insights that could be pivotal for understanding and enhancing energy security. It's a testament to the power of data analysis and the stories that numbers can tell, even when they initially appear without context.

Thank you for joining me in this unexpected exploration. 
Your time and curiosity are truly valued.
