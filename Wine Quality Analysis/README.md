*    **Data Cleaning:**
    The dataset was first inspected for missing values, outliers, and other inconsistencies. Outliers were addressed by creating separate dataframes for clean data without outliers (better_clean and worse_clean).

*    **Descriptive Statistics:**
    Basic statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation were computed to understand the central tendencies and dispersion of data attributes.

*    **Data Segmentation:**
    Wines were segmented based on their quality into three categories - better, worse, and all wines. This helped in drawing comparisons between the attributes of wines from different quality segments.

*    **Bar Charts for Variability:**
    Bar charts were plotted to compare the standard deviations and variances of various attributes across the wine categories. These visualizations provided insights into the variability of wine attributes within each quality segment.

*    **Correlation Analysis:**
    Heatmaps were generated to understand the pairwise correlation between all attributes for each wine category. Additionally, bar plots were used to display the correlation of each attribute with wine quality for each segment.

*    **Multiple Linear Regression:**
    A multiple linear regression model was constructed to understand the combined impact of wine attributes on its quality. This model provided insights into the relative importance of each attribute in predicting wine quality.
